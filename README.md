To play it is best to use the normal Version without a canvas. There first player one deals. And hides them. The same goes for player two. After both players have their cards, they can talk an bet. To hold a card click on it and then Change Cards to exchange them.

To reveal the winner use the who won? - button.

## Player

The top player is called Player1 and the bottom Player is Player2.

For all other cases the high card rule is used as tie breaker.
